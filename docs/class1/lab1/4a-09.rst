Add Another Rule List to the Policy
-----------------------------------

Use the **Policies** page to add the new firewall rule list to the
**rd_0_policy**.

Open the **Security > Network Firewall > Policies** page.

Click on the policy name to modify the policy.

The only current active rule list is for the **web_policy**. Click on
the arrow next to **Add Rule List, then select, Add the rule list AT
END)** to add the new rule list you just created. For **Name** begin
typing ‘application_rule_list’, select /Common/application_rule_list,
then click **Done Editing**.

Remember to Commit the changes to system before proceeding.

Once completed, you should see a policy similar to the one below:
