Stale Rule Report
=================

AFM also can list out stale rules within the device its self. You must
first enable the feature. 

**Navigation:** Security > Reporting > Settings > Reporting Settings

You will then need to ensure **Collect Stale Rules Statistics** is checked 
under the Network Firewall Rules Section. Please be sure to click 
**Save** before proceeding.

**Navigation:** Security > Reporting > Network > Stale Rules

Refresh the web page weâ€™ve been testing (http://10.1.20.11) 
several times to see data populate into the rules.

.. note:: It could take 60+ seconds for data to populate after refreshing the page.

This information is quite useful for keeping a rule base tidy and optimized.

Take a few minutes to inspect the other reports. Only the Enforced Rules will contain data.

This concludes the Advanced Multilayer Firewall Protection Lab. We hope you found this information
valuable.
