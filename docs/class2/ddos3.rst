Simulating a TCP SYN DDoS Attack
================================

In the last example, we crafted a packet that is easily identified as malicious, as its invalid. Weâ€™ll now simulate an attack with traffic that could be normal, acceptable traffic. The TCP SYN flood attack will attempt to DDoS a host by sending valid TCP traffic to a host from multiple source hosts. 

1. In the BIG-IP web UI, navigate to **Security** > **DoS Protection** > **Device Protection**.
2. Expand the **Network** section header in the vectors list to expand the view.
3. Click on **TCP Syn Flood** vector name.

4. Configure the vector with the following parameters:
    - **State**: *Mitigate*
    - **Threshold Mode**: *Fully Manual*
    - **Detection Threshold EPS**: *100*
    - **Detection Threshold Percent**: *200*
    - **Mitigation Threshold EPS**: *200*
    - **Simulate Auto Threshold**: Checked
5. Scroll to the top of the page and click **Commit Changes to System**.
6. Open the BIG-IP SSH session and scroll the ltm log in real time with the following command: 
    - ``tail -f /var/log/ltm``
7. On the attack host, launch the attack by issuing the following command on the BASH prompt: 
    - ``sudo hping3 10.1.10.6 --flood --rand-source --destport 80 --syn``
8. You will see messages showing the attack has been detected in the /var/log/ltm output:

. After about 60 seconds, stop the flood attack by pressing **CTRL+C**.
9. Return to the BIG-IP web UI and navigate to **Security** > **Event Logs** > **DoS** > **Network** > **Events**. Observe the log entries showing the details surrounding the attack detection and mitigation.

10. Navigate to **Security** > **Reporting** > **DoS** > **Dashboard** to view an overview of the DoS attacks and timeline. You can select filters in the filter pane to highlight the specific attack.

11. Finally, navigate to **Security** > **Reporting** > **DoS** > **Analysis**. View detailed statistics around the attack.
