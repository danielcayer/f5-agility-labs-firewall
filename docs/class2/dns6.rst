Remote Triggered Black Holing
-----------------------------

The BIG-IP supports the advertisement of bad actor(s) to upstream devices via BGP to block malicious traffic closer to the source. This is accomplished by publishing a blacklist to an external resource. This is not demonstrated in this lab.

Silverline Mitigation
---------------------

F5's cloud-based Silverline solution offers “always on” and “on demand” DDoS scrubbing that could assist in this scenario as well. This is not demonstrated in this lab.
