Stale Rule Report
=================

AFM also can list out stale rules within the device its self. You must
first enable the feature. To enable, navigate to **Security >Reporting >
Settings > Report Settings.** You will then need to check
“\ **Collect Stale Rules Statistics**\ ” found under the Network
Firewall Rules Section. Please be sure to click “Save” before
proceeding.

Once enabled, navigate to **Security >Reporting > Network > Stale
Rules.** Feel free to refresh the web page we’ve been testing with
(http://10.1.20.11) to see data populate into the rules.

.. NOTE:: It could take 60+ seconds for data to populate

This information is quite useful for keeping a rule base tidy and
optimized.

**Anyone can create a firewall rule, but who is the person that removes the unneccesary ones?**

Take a few minutes to inspect the other reports. Only the Enforced Rules wiill contain data

.. NOTE:: This concludes the Agility 2020 Advanced Multilayer Firewall Protection Lab. In addition to the exxercises completed, AFM offers a fullt functional IPS implementation, IP-Intelligence database capabilities and other advanced functionality.
