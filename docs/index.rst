F5 BIG-IP Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM) is a high-performance, full-proxy network security
solution designed to protect networks and data centers against incoming threats that enter
the network on the most widely deployed protocols. Built on F5â€™s industry-leading Application
Delivery Controller (ADC), BIG-IP AFM gives service providers a scalable, subscriber-aware
platform that delivers the flexibility, performance, and control needed to mitigate aggressive
distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and protocol attacks before they overwhelm and
degrade services. 

F5 offers superior application security with a flexible, ICSA-certified
etwork firewall, ICSA-certified web application firewall and a
comprehensive solution that defends against DDoS attacks by scaling
intelligently to mitigate DDOS attacks and other emerging threats at the
**network, session, and application** levels.
